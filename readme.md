Client for MMO Artifacts.
https://artifactsmmo.com/

This is my first program on python. I just wanted to try things that I learnt. I see almost all drawbacks of my way to see the client for this game, but I needed to write something.

To start play you need to get token from the site and save it to token.txt file. You need to create a character on the site of the game and then in file main.py you need to write the character's name on line 50.
To use/create/equip/uneqip item you need to write its code in lineedit and push the correct button.
Script can be as one word with number to repeat action, for example: gathering 50, or it can be sequence of action with number to repeat, for example: fight fight fight rest 100.
For some items there must be also written slot for that item, for example: iron_ring ring1 1.
